        <h5>dummy facts 01</h5>
        <p>
          Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different
          typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is
          nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
          non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to
          recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the
          distribution of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be
          distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and
          readability of the typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text
          on the page (layout or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually
          consists of a more or less random series of words or syllables. This
          prevents repetitive patterns from impairing the overall visual
          impression and facilitates the comparison of different typefaces.
          Furthermore, it is advantageous when the dummy text is relatively
          realistic so that the layout impression of the final publication is
          not compromised.
